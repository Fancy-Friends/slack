"""Slack, as one service descriptor shared by every Slack operation.

The Python twin of the js and php packages' service modules.

## The sandbox trap, written down where it is used

Install the app into a dedicated development workspace or Slack developer
sandbox. Messages are real inside that workspace, but its users and data are
separate from production. Developer sandboxes expire by default and have
feature and integration limits.
